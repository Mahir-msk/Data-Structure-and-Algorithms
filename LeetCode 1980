Given an array of strings nums containing n unique binary strings each of length n, return a binary string of length n that does not appear in nums. If there are multiple answers, you may return any of them.
Example 1:
Input: nums = ["01","10"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "00" would also be correct.

------Solution O(N)-------

string result = "";
    int n = nums.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result += (nums[i][i] == '0') ? '1' : '0';
    }
      return result;
  }
};
